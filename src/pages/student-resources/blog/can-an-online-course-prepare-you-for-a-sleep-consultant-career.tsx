            <h4>Learning at Home</h4>
            <p>You may not be able to access in-person sleep consultant courses in your region due to lack of schools and/or local interest in sleep training. Many people also can&apos;t or don&apos;t want to venture out to in-person schools right now, in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>
            <p><img className="img-fluid" src={require('../../../images/sr-focused-woman-wearing-headphones.jpg')} alt="focused woman wearing headphones" /></p>

            <h4>Practical Assignments</h4>
            <p>Your online course includes practical assignments that walk you through the process of developing a sleep plan. You&apos;ll practice working with clients, and creating and implementing individualized sleep plans so that you&apos;ll be confident when you launch your career.

            <h4>Formal Learning</h4>
            <p>When you&apos;re working with infants and their families, you NEED formal training to understand babies&apos; sleep needs and their development stages. Your clients trust you with the sleep plans for their babies and children. You need to be able to explain your decisions and recommendations to parents and caregivers.</p>
            <p>Blog articles and other informative sites are useful sources for sleep consultants. However, without formal training in infant sleep schedules and needs, you won&apos;t be able to provide high quality services.</p>
            <p>Getting certified as an infant sleep consultant is worthwhile and will help you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improve client experiences with your business</li>
              <li>Enhance infant sleep quality and quantity</li>
              <li>Positively impact your clients&apos; day-to-day routine</li>
              <li>Gain referrals and positive reviews</li>
              <li>Increase your income!</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Sleep Consulting</h4>
            <p>You can learn all about sleep consulting through an online course. You&apos;ll receive personalized feedback from your sleep consultant tutor, as well as industry advice in the course videos.</p>
