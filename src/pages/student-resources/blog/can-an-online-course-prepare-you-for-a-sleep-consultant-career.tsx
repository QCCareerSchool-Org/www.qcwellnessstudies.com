            <h4>Can an Online Course Prepare You for a Sleep Consultant Career?</h4>
            <p>If you’re on the fence about choosing an online course to start your new career, we’re here to help! Online learning provides students with lots of advantages. You can choose when and where you study, and how long your study sessions last.</p>
            <p>As a student with QC Wellness Studies, you’ll learn everything you need to know to kickstart your new sleep consultant career!</p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at how an online course can prepare you to work as an infant sleep consultant.</p>
            <div>
              <p><img className="img-fluid" src={require('../../../images/sr-mother-putting-baby-sleep-crib.jpg')} alt="Mother putting baby to sleep in a crib" /></p>
            </div>
            <h4>Flexible Learning</h4>
            <p>With an online course, you’ll be able to learn flexibly, at your leisure and suit your own timetable. You can revisit online course materials and refer back to the content as many times as you need to.</p>
            <p>If you’re busy working during the day, you’ll be able to log in to study your online course at night. You won’t need to commute to a physical campus. Learn to become a sleep consultant when you have time and energy to focus on your dream career. With QC’s online courses you can get certified and start earning money as a sleep consultant in as little as 3 months!</p>
            <h4>Learning at Home</h4>
            <p>You may not be able to access in-person sleep consultant courses in your region due to lack of schools and/or local interest in sleep training. Many people also can’t or don’t want to venture out to in-person schools right now, in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>

              <p><img className="img-fluid" src={require('../../../images/sr-focused-woman-wearing-headphones.jpg')} alt="newborn baby sleeps with toy" /></p>
            </div>
            <p>Studying online is a great alternative to in-person classes. An online course is convenient, flexible and you can study your online sleep consulting course from anywhere, including in the comfort of your own home!</p>
            <h4>Practical Assignments</h4>
            <p>Your online course includes practical assignments that walk you through the process of developing a sleep plan. You’ll practice working with clients, and creating and implementing individualized sleep plans so that you’ll be confident when you launch your career. As you progress through the course, you’ll complete assignments to test your new skills. Then, when you reach the final unit you’ll complete a cumulative project in which you’ll conduct the consultation process from start to finish just like you would with a real client.</p>
            <h4>Personalized Feedback</h4>
            <p>Your online sleep consultant course is created with you in mind. Course materials, such as textbooks, videos and assignments, will take you through the consulting process and help you create sleep plans.</p>
            <p>As a QC Wellness Studies student, you’ll receive personalized feedback on your course assignments. Expert sleep consultant tutors provide feedback and information about sleep consulting to improve your understanding of course content. Your tutor will ensure you receive detailed and beneficial feedback. You’ll never have to guess what you need to improve on as a QC student!</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Formal Learning</h4>
            <p>When you’re working with infants and their families, you NEED formal training to understand babies’ sleep needs and their development stages. Your clients trust you with the sleep plans for their babies and children. You need to be able to explain your decisions and recommendations to parents and caregivers.</p>
            <p>Blog articles and other informative sites are useful sources for sleep consultants. However, without formal training in infant sleep schedules and needs, you won’t be able to provide high quality services.</p>
            <p>Getting certified as an infant sleep consultant is worthwhile and will help you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improve client experiences with your business</li>
              <li>Enhance infant sleep quality and quantity</li>
              <li>Positively impact your clients’ day-to-day routine</li>
              <li>Gain referrals and positive reviews</li>
              <li>Increase your income!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sleep Consulting</h4>
            <p>You can learn all about sleep consulting through an online course. You’ll receive personalized feedback from your sleep consultant tutor, as well as industry advice in the course videos.</p>
            <p>During QC Wellness Studies’ Infant Sleep Consultant Course, you’ll learn about:</p>
