            <h4>Coordinating Multiple Bedtimes</h4>
            <p>For households with multiple children, you&apos;ll need to plan several bedtimes. Older children usually go to bed slightly later than infants and can sometimes keep their younger siblings awake. Keep older siblings quiet and calm while an infant is asleep by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Planning quiet indoor activities, such as puzzles, drawing, reading and TV time either during the baby&apos;s naptimes or bedtime</li>
              <li>Including older siblings in the infant&apos;s bedtime routine, such as group story times and pre-bedtime snacks</li>
              <li>Spend quality quiet time with each child individually to make them feel loved and secure</li>
            </ul>
