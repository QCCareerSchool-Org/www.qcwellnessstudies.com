              <p>A sleep consultant or "sleep coach" is a professional expertly trained to help parents and caregivers create a safe and healthy sleep habit for their infants and toddlers. You'll consult with parents and caregivers on their child's needs and the methods they're comfortable with, and then work with them to establish a bedtime routine that will work for their child. You'll consult on common bedtime/night time problems to help the child sleep comfortably through the night, so that the parents can get adequate rest, too!</p>
            </div>
            <div className="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5">
              <p>Some sleep consultants specialize in one-time consultations or coaching sessions. Others offer full-service consulting, where they will visit their client's home for several days or weeks in order to solve the child's sleep problems. And of course, you can offer a range of services to suit any client that comes your way! This highly specialized practice is perfectly suited to anyone who already works in the child care or healthcare industries, or anyone who has a knack for working with children.</p>
