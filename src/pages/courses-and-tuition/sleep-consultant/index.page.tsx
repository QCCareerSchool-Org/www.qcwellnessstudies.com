            <p>A sleep consultant or &ldquo;sleep coach&rdquo; is a professional expertly trained to help parents and caregivers create safe and healthy sleep habits for their children. Although sleep consultants primarily focus on infant sleep issues, with QC&apos;s certification you&apos;ll be well prepared to help the whole family improve their sleep habits. You&apos;ll consult with parents and caregivers on their child&apos;s needs and the methods they&apos;re comfortable with, and then work with them to establish a bedtime routine that will work for their child. You&apos;ll consult on common bedtime/nighttime problems to help the child sleep comfortably through the night, so that the parents can get adequate rest, too!</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5">
            <p>Some sleep consultants specialize in one-time consultations or coaching sessions. Others offer full-service consulting, where they will visit their client&apos;s home for several days or weeks in order to solve the child&apos;s sleep problems. And of course, you can offer a range of services to suit any client that comes your way!</p>

            <ul className="mb-4">
              <li><p><strong>Patience</strong> &mdash; Infants and toddlers are vulnerable human beings with diverse personalities. Caregivers are often stressed, busy, and overwhelmed. This is where you come in. You need to bring calm and order to stressful conditions.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong> &mdash; Both children and their caregivers have different needs and preferences. You need to be attentive to these differences and be able to adapt your approach depending on the child or caregiver. Sometimes that means putting your own preferences aside and striving to do what&apos;s best for your clients.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Reliability</strong> &mdash; As a professional, you&apos;ll be expected to adhere to a set schedule. Time management skills are essential to succeed in this career.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Care &amp; Compassion</strong> &mdash; You&apos;re going to be working with newborns, babies, and toddlers every day. Sometimes they&apos;ll be difficult, for a variety of different reasons. You&apos;ll need to be empathetic as they adjust to their new routines.</p></li>
