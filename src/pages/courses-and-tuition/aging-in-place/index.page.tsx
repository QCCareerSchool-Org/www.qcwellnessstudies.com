              <li><p><strong>Interior Decorating Certification/Experience</strong> &mdash; This advanced course is for previously certified decorating professionals. If you do not have previous experience in the design industry, you&apos;ll want to <a href="https://www.qcdesignschool.com/online-courses/interior-decorating/">become a certified interior decorator</a> before taking this Aging in Place course.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Business &amp; Marketing Expertise</strong> &mdash; Since this course is an advanced course for certified decorating professionals, the course does not contain business training. You will need to rely on your own business and marketing experience to sell your aging in place services to potential clients.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Reliability, Flexibility &amp; Empathy</strong> &mdash; Working with aging in place clients can require a greater degree of sensitivity than your usual design and decorating clients. Being able to connect with your aging clients on a personal level and offer them greater flexibility when scheduling consultations will be a great way to garner their trust!</p></li>

You&apos;ll learn about the responsibilities of an AIP designer and how AIP services differ from other types of design work. You&apos;ll also learn about common physiological changes, medical conditions, and lifestyle changes people experience as they age, and about all of the different housing and support options available to people facing aging-related challenges. This unit will also teach you how act as an AIP educator and market your services effectively.</p>

              <p className="mb-0">Unit B focuses on developing the skills required to assess client needs, evaluate homes from an AIP perspective, and create AIP modification plans. You&apos;ll start by learning about the design standards AIP professionals use to guide their work, including universal design, accessible design and visitable design. You&apos;ll then learn how to apply these principles to assess clients&apos; homes and make effective design recommendations. This unit will also teach you how you can incorporate decluttering and home transition services into your AIP business.</p>

              <p className="mb-0">This unit will ask you to work with the home of a friend or relative. The home&apos;s resident(s) can be any age and at any stage of life. You will simply be assessing the home as if it belonged to an AIP client. You&apos;ll start by assessing the whole home in broad terms. In later assignments, you&apos;ll focus on two specific rooms in the home. You can choose any type of room (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, entryway, etc.). However, to get the most from this project, we recommend that you pick a room in which you can make a number of suggestions for AIP improvements. A room that is already AIP-ready won&apos;t allow you to practice applying all of your new skills.</p>
