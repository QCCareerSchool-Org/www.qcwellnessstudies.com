              <p>The professional caregiver course is divided into six units. You&apos;ll start by learning the basics of caregiving, and then build on that knowledge as you work your way through the course. Once you&apos;ve completed the course, you&apos;ll be fully qualified to work as an independent professional caregiver!</p>

              <h3 className="text-dark">Unit A: Introduction to<br />Caregiving</h3>
              <p>In this first unit, you&apos;ll learn what it means to be a professional caregiver. You&apos;ll learn the details of the job, how you&apos;ll interact with clients, and (just as importantly) what types of duties you WON&apos;T be expected to complete. You&apos;ll then learn how to perform your initial client consultation, including what information you&apos;ll need to collect, and how to evaluate safety requirements for each client. Finally, you&apos;ll learn how to establish and work with a detailed care plan for every client you take on.</p>

              <h3 className="text-dark">Unit B: Working with<br />Clients</h3>
              <p>Now that you have a good idea of your role as a caregiver, you&apos;ll start to learn how to put that knowledge to use when working with clients. Your clients will have a number of different challenges they face every day. As a caregiver, you&apos;ll have to work hard at remaining professional and establishing healthy boundaries with your clients while still developing meaningful relationships. This can be a tricky skill to master! Later in the unit, you&apos;ll focus on understanding your client&apos;s unique needs based on their own challenges.</p>

              <p>In this next unit, you&apos;ll dive into the specific services you&apos;ll offer as a caregiver, and start developing those skills. Whether you plan on providing all these services once you start your business, it&apos;s important to have the full range of skills required to be a successful caregiver. This unit will also allow you to explore the different workplace settings available to you, should you choose to work for a caregiving agency instead of starting your own business.</p>

              <h3 className="text-dark">Unit D: Technical Skills</h3>
              <p>This highly practical unit is where you&apos;ll learn the core technical skills any Caregiver needs to have. When working with individuals who have limited independence, caregivers are sometimes required to help with basic daily tasks such as dressing, toileting, bathing/showering, or helping their client move around, for example. There are very specific methods to follow that are safe and ensure you preserve your client&apos;s dignity as you perform these delicate tasks.</p>

              <p>In Unit E, you&apos;ll read a variety of hypothetical challenging situations and learn how to handle each one. You&apos;ll use the scenarios outlined in your course text as a guide to help you start thinking like a Formal Caregiver. Then you&apos;ll complete scenario-based assignments to practice interacting with clients in challenging situations.</p>
